# Birdsong
Play the sounds of birds recently spotted in the UK using eBird and Macaulay Library.

To run the script you will need to create an account on eBird and request an API key. 
For maximum enjoyment, run the script on a constantly connected Raspberry Pi connected to a speaker (ie surface transducer + Adafruit MAX98357A 3W amp) and enjoy daily encounters UK twitchers experience within your own home in near realtime :)
